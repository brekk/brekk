### Brekk ¬∑ he/him
[brekk.is](https://brekk.is)

I'm Brekk (like breakfast). I'm a JavaScript-centric developer and Web Designer. I love functional programming (and I wrote about it [here](https://codepen.io/brekk/post/functional-workaholism)). 

#### Madlib

In the past few years I've been working with my buddy [Arnaud](https://github.com/aboeglin) on [Madlib](https://madlib.space), a compiled language which was originally envisioned as a blend of JavaScript and Haskell types. You can see more about the project on Github [here](https://github.com/madlib-lang/madlib).

Lots of in-progress ideas:

##### Tools
- [party-bus](https://github.com/brekk/party-bus) - structured logs
- [utter](https://github.com/brekk/utter) - state machine
- [clinic](https://github.com/brekk/clinic) - CLI-app toolkit
- [madgraph](https://github.com/brekk/madgraph) - DOT language parser and graph generator
- [nathan-brazil](https://github.com/brekk/nathan-brazil) - markov chains
- [jam](https://github.com/brekk/jam) - automatic file-backing for stateful applications
- [diurnal](https://github.com/brekk/diurnal) - a CLI-based daily progress tracker

##### Community
- [pickaxe](https://github.com/brekk/pickaxe) - tool to convert obsidian-style notes into a structure
- [spinneret](https://github.com/brekk/spinneret) - possible re-imagining of [madui](https://github.com/madlib-lang/madui)
